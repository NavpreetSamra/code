Thank you for reviewing my work, I look forward to hearing your feedback. This pdf is built with Sphinx, which is a tool designed primarily for building html, and as a result has a few quirks and in general is not as aesthetic. If you woud like to see the html version it's available via Google Drive in the zip here: the root is at uber/docs/build/html/index.html. I can also push it to githubpages if that would make anyone's life easier.

Thanks again,

Mark
