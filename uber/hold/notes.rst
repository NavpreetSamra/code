Abnormalities in the data

Vehicle Make
============

It's unclear if this is data is strictly for Uber auto, which if it is would likely prevent *bicycle*  *bike* vehicles from participating. Given that 1 bike / bicycle had a succesful first trip it is either likely an incorrect vehicle make entry or potentially part of the Uber Eats or another non auto program. 

As well, there is are  *walker* and *autobot* vehicle make.

It's possible there is a new or small auto manufacturer, but a quick google search did not find any, more in depth analysis is possible here but for hte sake of expediency this row is dropped as well.
With more information or a picture, which could help differentiate a walking aid from an AT-AT or AT-ST from LucasFilms/ Lucas Ranch, and similarly for the autobots.

Moving forward vehicle make could be a very valuable feature, however to best use it likely requries at least profiling and preferably topic modeling grouping types of cars- sedans vs suv (xl eligible) and / or luxury vehicle (eligible for Black).
