<h2>INTRODUCTION<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The purpose of this analysis is to understand what features of a user
contribute to user adoption.
Before proceeding, two critical points to remember throughout
this process are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>This data is artificial</li>
<li>We do not have infinite time</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We have an <em>engagement table</em> containing <em>login history</em>: <em>userid</em> and <em>timestamp</em>
for each user&#8217;s login and a <em>users table</em> containing various attributes
of users.
The following details
an inspection and exploration process of the provided data in an
effort to determine what factors have the greatest impact on
predicting user adoption. From there we will begin to embed the
<strong>maven</strong> user as
a feature with the goal of improving prediction
as well as better understanding drivers of user adoption. The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a> as described by Malcom
Gladwell in
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point">The Tipping Point</a></p>
<p>Data inspection reveals attributes belonging to
2 broad categorizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>User</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>name</li>
<li>object_id</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>org_id</li>
<li>last_session_create_time</li>
<li>opted_in_to_mailing_list</li>
<li>enabled_for_marketing_drip</li>
<li>login history (timestamp)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Path to Company</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>creation_source (5 categories)</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>GUEST_INVITE</li>

<li><p class="first">invited_by_user_id</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>With the exception of <em>login history</em>, this data is organized in a single
table. We proceed by calculating whether or not a user has adopted
given the criteria (3 logins in a 7 day window) and joining that
data to our <em>users table</em>. To do so, we group the login data
by <em>user_id</em>, sort by timestamp represented as <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">pandas.DatetimeIndex</span></code> and
pass a window over the array to check for length of time between
a login and the login after the following login, (i, i+2). If that
delta in time is less then or equal to 7 days we break out of our iteration
and record the user as <em>adopted</em>. An important note
throughout this analysis: we have utilized login time
and frequency to create the target for our prediction and consequently
we must be very careful when including number of logins
in any prediction of user adoption, otherwise we
will suffer from leakage. We also note that at casual inspection
there are no drastic outliers in the <em>users table</em>, however there is
potentially an issue with the <em>engagement table</em> data that we will address
in the next section. Further analysis of <em>users table</em>
with studentized-t residuals can be used to investigate outliers, however
beacuse our analysis will mainly pertain to
categorical data, outlier analysis will likely not play a
signifigant role.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cleaning">
<h2>CLEANING<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We remove <em>name</em> and <em>email</em> from our table. While it&#8217;s possible
certain types of email addresses can be indicative of
browser types and trends do exist within names
(see Freakanomics) that analysis is deprioritized here
and those fields are removed from our feature space.</p>
<p>Since <em>creation_source</em> is nominal with 5 unique values we dummify
the column and store it. It is important to note that the
stored data has not dropped a column, so a category
can be dropped before modeling to combat collinearity.</p>
<p>One path we can follow here is to investigate adoption rate within
organizations. This is logical, however given this approach, we
would look to perform this after embedding the <strong>maven</strong> or other profiles of users
(assuming we can find them). To produce the most useful
information from the analysis, we need more information about
the organizations themselves (size, industry, growth, etc).
This would be one of the next few steps
to follow our approach begun in the <cite>MODELING</cite> section
below.</p>
<p>We choose to remove time from our predictions for two reasons,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Time (ours, not the datas). Because we use time
in our calculation of adoption rate, we must be
extremely careful with building features that
incorporate the same data. Also, given the
suggested time to spend on this analysis we
choose to allocate our time on what we hope
will be more accesible and lower hanging but
also interesting fruit.</li>
<li>To properly understand the impact of time
on our system we need more information
about the product, feature releases, market
ecosystem, company history, and outreach.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That all being said, we can still look at time and gain useful
information. Plotting logins by day we see an
increasing rate of logins per day (a good sign
for product health!) until 2014-05-21.</p>
<p>The data after that point demonstrates a system level impact that
indicates a catastrophic failure. A likley scenerio here
is that the logging of logins began to fail, whether
because of a snapshot push or other issues, it begins to spread
and then the bottom drops out on 2014-06-05. While world,
or product/company catastrophy is possible, given our
general knowledge they are likley not the cause.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/LoginsPerDay.png"><img alt="_images/LoginsPerDay.png" class="align-center" src="_images/LoginsPerDay.png" style="width: 600.0px; height: 450.0px;" /></a>

<p>The number of accounts created by day likely confirms
this theory, and
suggests that the increase in rate of account
creation at the end of this timeframe exceeded the load the system
was designed to handle leading to the failure in capturing logins,
without ruling out some of the possibilities enumerated above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-analysis">
<h2>INITIAL ANALYSIS<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With a clean and numeric representation of the data we are now able
to investigate the impact of features on adoption.
To do so we will look at extracting feature importance
from three modeling techniques: Logistic Regression,
Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The magnitude of a (scaled) feature&#8217;s coefficient
in Logistic Regression represents the impact an increment change of that feature has on final classification, by
it&#8217;s contribution to the slope defining the hyperplane
associated with that feature&#8217;s component
(with the caveat of holding all other features constant).
Logistic Regression&#8217;s direct readability of the impact variations
in a feature make it a useful tool for it&#8217;s interpretability.
Decision Trees, while highly prone to overfitting for
predicative modeling are useful for their interpretability
of feature importance by calculating the gain of information
of a split on a feature at a node. Random Forest is an ensemble
method utilizing a collection of Decision Trees but uses bootstrapped data
and random subselection of features to split on within each tree to
decorrelate the trees, which reduces the variance and propensity
to overfit of Decision Trees.</p>
<p>With this analysis we use coefficients for Logistic Regression
normalized gini impurity for Decision Trees and relative feature importance for Random Forest
to evaluate the impact a feature has on predicting <em>user adoption</em>. The results in the
following tables represent values from averaging 10 fold cross
validation where standard deviations of all values are 1-2 orders
of magniutde less then the values presented (excluding 0s). The following models
were run with default parameters from
<a class="reference external" href="https://http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html">sklearn</a>
as this is an initial investigation. Since our data is long relative to its width
we refrain from utilizing regularization in Logistic Regression. Since our current goal
is to understand <em>User Adoption</em> we refrain from tree pruning to better use our time on analysis.
For our Random Forest we use 10 trees and did not find signifigant differences
in feature importance when increasing the the number of trees in our model, noting
that holding all else constant increasing the number of trees in a Random Forest will not lead to overfitting.
For prediction moving forward
we can look at modifying the number of the splits and/or depth allowed in our forest. For prediction we would
also drop Decision Trees and focus on using Logistic Regression and Random Forests, with the potential for
a Support Vector Machine Classifier and introducing Boosting to modeling tool suite.</p>
<p>We also take the opportunity here to address
why we decided not to dummify <em>org_id</em>. As discussed (and
will continue to be discussed) a lack of information about
the orgs is a contributing factor, but also would render
a Decision Tree substantially less useful and woud increase the
computation time for a Random Forest (we recognize that
RFs are parallelizable).</p>

<blockquote>
<div>The take away from the above table is that the methods of invitation
are more important then being on the mailing list or a marketing drip.
Also please note, that values of our tree based methods represent
relative magnitude and cannot imply direction (another perk of Logistic Regression).
Since all our features are categorical, coefficients of the Logistic
Regression are easy to compare.</div></blockquote>

<h2>MODELING<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>An initial exploration into feature importance gives insight into
what is available at the surface of our data. However, to
better understand Company users and what drives adoption
we look to understand the impact and types of users and
organizations. While there is a wide breadth of directions
we can proceed from here, we will focus on one organizational
attribute -size- to help inform  one aspect of users
- sign up connectivity- which is a first step in
identifying <strong>mavens</strong>.</p>
<p>Calculating organization size, in the context of this analysis is
the number of Company users, which belong to that organzation. We group users by
<em>org_id</em> and count them. From there we begin to build a framework
to analyze <strong>mavens</strong>.
With the available data we are only able to investigate users
who have or exist in the <em>invited_by_user_id</em> field</p>
<p>We hypothesize that inertia of tool usage exists within organizations
and look to understand that spread through usage and knowledge levels</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>0th level</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">When a user is succesful with a tool, the tool is more
likely to spread because the user will recommend it to other
members of the organization.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>1st level</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">A team wide decision to use a common
tool for a specific function</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>2nd level</dt>
<dd><p class="first last"><strong>Mavens</strong> are users
who work to become power users and then act as advocates/
evangelists for the software which is likely to increase
the signup rate and adoption rate of those users.
The <strong>maven</strong> will share the power of the tool, yielding a
shallower learning curve for new users and an increase
in adoption due to learning curve + <strong>maven</strong> usage.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining with
tool/software standardization across teams and throughout
verticals, <strong>mavens</strong> provide us a target profile to
model with a goal of understanding tool flow throughout
organizations.</p>
<p>We will begin building the framework to model <strong>mavens</strong> by
investigating connectivity.
In order to integrate connectivity as a feature for modeling
we build an undirected graph of each organization. Because
a node can only have 1 parent, and we have that recorded
in our features we can use an undirected graph to make the
computation of calculating connected subcomponents faster.
We also threshold a connected component having a local rank
greater then 3 for emphasis. This can be further investigated
in future work.
We maintain the ability to easily switch to a directed graph
moving forward if that structure suits our needs better.
Now we are able to add the local connected component rank of
a user as well as how many children
that user has to our design matrix.</p>
<p>With these new features we look at the impact on feature importance
and predictive ability in our three models (Note org_size is
number of Company accounts belonging to that user&#8217;s <em>org_id</em>
and continuous variables have been normalized to have a
standard deviation of 1 in the design matrix
which implies dx for a continuous variable is interpreted
differently from a categorical variable in Logistic Regression

<blockquote>
<div><p>While the tree based methods find our engineered features
rich in information. The Logistic Regression throws away <em>local_rank</em>.
Given how we&#8217;ve constructed these features in our design matrix
there is some redundancy
of information. Creating different models based on grouping sign up
methods could be a good direction to take our work and garner more
insight into features contributing to adoption. We note that our
pipeline includes a check of <strong>Variance Inflation Factor</strong> in
constructing our design matrix, and will raise an exception
if the magnitude of any feature exceeds a VIF of 3.</p>
<p>Closer inspection reveals an overall downard trend of <em>org_size</em>
as we would expect from our Logit coefficient. One interesting
phenomenon that we did not expect and likely hinders the success
of <em>children</em> and <em>local_rank</em> features is the 0 adoption rate
among users with 11 or more children. This is contrary to our
<strong>maven</strong> hypothesis. One potential explanation for these users
is they send the reference link and are part of onboarding process but choose
another tool within their own team.
We do not currently have time within this analysis to include login
frequency in a constructive manner, however this attribute would likely
help us partition <strong>mavens</strong> from <strong>connectors</strong> and improve our model.
The next immediate step we can take is to add a feature of whether a user
was referred by an existing adopted user. Even though this does not cause
leakage we have two paths we can follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Whether the parent was adopted
at time of recommendation is likley the best implementation
but not a feature we can directly drop into our design matrix
without more computation</li>
<li>Whether the parent ever adopted. However this is not
as useful because it create bias in our training data.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>

<p>We continue to find <em>mailing_list</em> and <em>marketing_drip</em> to not
effectively contribute. At this point if we were to continue
to build our model we would try dropping these features and
measure the impact on accuracy as well as recall and precision.</p>
<p>We will take this opportunity to discuss class imbalance in our
system. With only a 13.8% adoption rate, when moving forward
with modeling efforts we will need to account for this. A variety
of techniques can be used, depending on resources and application,
but given available information SMOAT is likely a good first step to
improving the accuracy when we look to predict. In a
parallel thread we also bring up that accuracy is likely not the best
scoring metric, but to give a more useful scoring metric
and direction to take the model we need to better understand
what the results are going to drive.</p>
<p>These factors all combine to yield no signifigant change in the
accuracy of our model calculated during cross validation.</p>
<p>This is just the initial framework. From here
we could incorporate usage frequency at time of recommendation,
success rate of invited members, and the velocity of the rank
of the graph as potentially interesting and meaningful features
in our model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>CONCLUSION<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With more information about organizations and specific users, user
and organizational profiles can help drive product development
and pricing (pricing, because we then have a way to evaluate
traction within organizations). Moving forward we can look to
incorporate more detailed information about types of organizations
as well as user application and use history/profiles.</p>
<p>While these next steps all appear to contain great power,
they are meaningless if the computation to perform the analysis is
intractable. The pulling of data can be moved to a database style
context which is optimized for grouping and reorganizing data
around an index. The structure of the code utilized lends itself
well to partitioning for parallel processing with (key, value) pairs.
An advantage of user and organizationl profiling is the creation of
intuitive ways to partition the data. Once profiles are complete
we can track the change in profiles by comparing subsets windowed
by time  which again provides
natural partitions to our processing. If our data become so verbose
that Spark and AWS computation become intractable, we can sample
from our data for modeling and evaluation.</p>
